### **The Archon Refactor Sprint: The One-Month Gauntlet**

**Objective:** To transform the Archon prototype into a stable, clean, and usable v1.0 foundation within a 30-day period, setting the stage for future feature development and public launch.

#### **Week 1: The Purge (Days 1-7)**

- **Focus:** **Aggressive Refactoring & Debt Pay-down.**
- **Tasks:**
  - Continue "extracting the scaffolds." Rip out all placeholder code, dead components, and legacy logic.
  - Resolve all `Critical` and `High` priority issues from our AI-generated **Technical Debt Report.**
  - Clean up the auth flow. Ensure the `middleware.ts` is flawless.
  - Standardize the file structure and naming conventions.
- **Goal:** To have a clean, stable, and predictable foundation to build upon.

#### **Week 2: The Core Loop (Days 8-14)**

- **Focus:** **Achieving "Daily Driver" Status.**
- **Tasks:**
  - Solidify the core task management CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.
  - Ensure the app is fast, reliable, and enjoyable enough for **you** to use it to manage your own daily tasks, finally killing the Google Sheet tracker.
- **Goal:** To make Archon the official, internal PM tool for the ScaleSmart empire.

#### **Week 3: The "Wow" Feature (Days 15-21)**

- **Focus:** **Implementing the first major, user-facing feature.**
- **Task:** Build the **Kanban Board** view. This is a highly visual, high-impact feature that immediately demonstrates Archon's power as an Asana-killer.
- **Goal:** To have a feature so good that you would be excited to show it to a potential user (or a future interviewer).

#### **Week 4: The Polish & Prep (Days 22-30)**

- **Focus:** **Bug Squashing & Future-Proofing.**
- **Tasks:**
  - Hunt down and fix all remaining bugs.
  - Refine the UI/UX. Make it beautiful.
  - Write the documentation for the new, refactored codebase.
- **Goal:** To have a `v1.0` candidate that is stable, documented, and ready for the next phase of the `financial-freedom-system`.
