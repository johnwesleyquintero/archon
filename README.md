## Overview

Archon is a modern, responsive dashboard application built with Next.js 14 (App Router), React Server Components, and Supabase. It provides a comprehensive solution for personal productivity and organization, featuring robust authentication, seamless data management, and a sleek, dark-themed user interface. Manage your tasks, track your goals, and organize your journal entries efficiently, all in one place.

## Features

- **Responsive Dashboard Layout**: Enjoy a sleek, dark-themed user interface that seamlessly adapts to various screen sizes, complete with a collapsible sidebar for enhanced navigation.
- **Robust User Authentication**: Securely sign up and sign in using Supabase Auth, supporting both email/password and Google OAuth. User profiles are automatically created upon registration.
- **Dynamic Task Management**: A comprehensive system for adding, completing, deleting, filtering, and sorting tasks. Includes a dedicated "Today's Tasks" widget with robust state management.
- **Strategic Goal Tracking**: Set and monitor your strategic goals with intuitive progress bars and status badges. Attach relevant documents directly to your goals for easy access.
- **Rich Journaling System**: Create and manage journal entries using a versatile rich text editor, supporting various templates and file attachments for comprehensive record-keeping.
- **Personalized User Settings**: Customize your experience by managing profile information, account settings, and appearance preferences, including avatar uploads and a convenient dark/light mode toggle.
- **Efficient File Uploads**: Seamlessly integrate and store files across journal entries, goals, and user avatars with efficient Vercel Blob storage.
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Leverage **GroqFast AI Inference** for rapid, low-latency AI responses, enabling intelligent features like smart suggestions, content generation, and conversational AI.
- **Reusable UI Components**: Utilize generic `LoadingSkeleton`, `EmptyState`, and `ErrorState` components to gracefully handle common UI scenarios, providing excellent user feedback and a consistent experience.
- **Modular & Maintainable Codebase**: The application is built with a modular architecture, breaking down components into smaller, reusable pieces with clear separation of concerns (e.g., custom hooks like `useTasks` for logic abstraction), ensuring high maintainability and scalability.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 14 (App Router)**: Utilizes the latest Next.js features for server-centric routing, React Server Components, and efficient API routes.
- **React**: Powers the interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety across the codebase, enhancing code quality and developer experience.
- **Supabase**: Provides a robust Backend-as-a-Service, handling authentication and serving as the PostgreSQL database.
- **Groq**: Integrated for ultra-fast AI inference, leveraging Language Processing Units (LPUs) for low-latency responses [^1].
- **AI SDK**: A powerful TypeScript toolkit designed for building AI-powered applications [^2].
- **Tailwind CSS**: Enables rapid and highly customizable UI development with a utility-first CSS framework.
- **shadcn/ui**: Offers a collection of beautifully designed, reusable UI components built on Radix UI and styled with Tailwind CSS.
- **Lucide React**: Provides a comprehensive and customizable set of open-source icons.
- **Vercel Blob**: Ensures efficient and scalable file storage for various application assets.
- **next-themes**: Facilitates easy integration and management of dark/light mode themes.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Archon Dashboard locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/johnwesleyquintero/archon.git
cd archon
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install

# or

yarn install
```

### 3. Set Up Supabase

1.  **Create a Supabase Project**: If you don't have one, sign up at [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and create a new project.
2.  **Get API Keys**: Go to your Supabase project dashboard, navigate to `Project Settings > API`. Copy your `Project URL` and `anon public` key.
3.  **Configure Environment Variables**: Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add the following:

    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

    # Optional: For server-side operations that require elevated permissions

    SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY

    # Vercel Blob Storage (if using file uploads)

    BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=YOUR_BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN

    # Groq AI Inference

    GROQ_API_KEY=YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY
    ```

    Replace `YOUR_SUPABASE_URL`, `YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `YOUR_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `YOUR_BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`, and `YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY` with your actual credentials.

### 4. Run Database Migrations

The project includes a SQL script to set up the necessary tables and Row Level Security (RLS) policies in your Supabase database, including a trigger for automatic user profile creation.

1.  Go to your Supabase project dashboard.
2.  Navigate to `SQL Editor`.
3.  Open the `scripts/create-tables.sql` file from this repository.
4.  Copy the entire content of `create-tables.sql` and paste it into the Supabase SQL Editor.
5.  Run the query. This will create `profiles`, `tasks`, `goals`, and `journal_entries` tables, along with RLS policies and a trigger to automatically create a profile for new user sign-ups.

### 5. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev

# or

yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## Development Workflow

1. **Branch Creation**: Create a new branch for each feature or bugfix

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bugfix-name
   ```

2. **Code Style**: The project uses ESLint and Prettier for code formatting

   ```bash
   # Run ESLint
   npm run lint

   # Format code with Prettier
   npm run format
   ```

3. **Type Checking**: Ensure TypeScript compilation succeeds

   ```bash
   npm run type-check
   ```

4. **Testing**: Run tests before submitting PR

   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

5. **Commit Messages**: Follow conventional commits format
   ```bash
   feat: add new feature
   fix: resolve bug
   docs: update documentation
   style: format code
   refactor: restructure code
   test: add tests
   chore: update dependencies
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Supabase Connection Issues**
   - Verify your environment variables are correctly set
   - Ensure your IP is allowlisted in Supabase dashboard
   - Check if the database is accessible

2. **Build Errors**
   - Clear your `.next` cache: `rm -rf .next`
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
   - Verify Node.js version matches the project requirements

3. **Authentication Problems**
   - Confirm Supabase authentication is properly configured
   - Check if the necessary auth providers are enabled
   - Verify redirect URLs are correctly set

4. **File Upload Issues**
   - Validate Vercel Blob storage configuration
   - Check file size limits
   - Verify proper CORS settings

## Deployment

This project is designed to be easily deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

1.  **Connect to Vercel**: If you haven't already, connect your Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) to Vercel.
2.  **Configure Environment Variables**: Ensure you add the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`, and `GROQ_API_KEY` environment variables to your Vercel project settings.
3.  **Deploy**: Vercel will automatically detect the Next.js project and deploy it.
